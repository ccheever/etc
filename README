My .vimrc and other configuration files

To install git clone into your home directory, and then do

    ln -s $HOME/etc/vimrc $HOME/.vimrc

If you already have a custom .vimrc, this won't work and you'll have to 
do something like add a line like

    source $HOME/etc/vimrc 

to the bottom of your custom .vimrc
