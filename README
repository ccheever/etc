vimrc configuration for Charlie Cheever

To install git clone into a directory called `vimrc` in your home
directory, and then do

    ln -s $HOME/vimrc/vimrc $HOME/.vimrc

If you already have a custom .vimrc, this won't work and you'll have to 
do something like add a line like

    source $HOME/vimrc/vimrc 

to the bottom of your custom .vimrc
